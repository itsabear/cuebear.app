**Last Updated:** September 30, 2025

## Introduction

Cue Bear is a MIDI controller app designed for live performance use. This privacy policy explains what data the app collects, how it's used, and your rights regarding your information.

## Data We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

Cue Bear stores the following data **only on your device**:

- **Project Files (.cuebearproj)**: Your setlists, song names, MIDI mappings, and control button configurations
- **App Preferences**: Theme settings, last opened project name, and connection preferences

## How Data is Used

### Local Network Communication

Cue Bear uses your device's local network to:
- **Discover Mac computers** running the Cue Bear Bridge app via Bonjour (`.cuebear._tcp` service)
- **Send MIDI messages** to your Mac over WiFi or USB connection
- **Maintain connection state** between your iPad and Mac during performances

This communication stays **completely private** between your iPad and Mac. No data leaves your local network.

### iCloud Sync (Optional)

If you enable iCloud Drive, Cue Bear can:
- **Sync your project files** across your devices using Apple's iCloud infrastructure
- **All syncing is handled by iOS** - we don't access or transmit your iCloud data

iCloud sync is optional and controlled by your iOS system settings.

## Data Storage

### On-Device Storage
- Project files are stored in your device's Documents directory
- Preferences are stored in UserDefaults (standard iOS app settings)
- All data is protected by iOS's built-in encryption and security

### No External Storage
- Cue Bear does **not** use external servers or cloud storage (except Apple's iCloud if you enable it)
- We do not store any data on our servers because we don't have any servers

## Third-Party Services

## Network Usage

### Local Network Access

Cue Bear requests local network access to:

This permission is **required** for the app to function. The app only communicates with devices on your local network and does not access the internet.

### No Internet Connection Required

Cue Bear works **completely offline**. It does not require an internet connection and does not transmit any data over the internet.

## Your Rights

### Access Your Data
All your data is stored in standard iOS formats:
- Project files: Accessible through the Files app

### Delete Your Data
You can delete all app data by:
1. Deleting project files through the app or Files app
2. Uninstalling the app (removes all app data)
3. Disabling iCloud sync (removes synced files from iCloud)

### Control Permissions

- **Local Network Access**: Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network > Cue Bear
- **iCloud Drive**: Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Apps Using iCloud > Cue Bear

## Children's Privacy

Cue Bear does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is designed for musicians and performers of all ages.

## Security

### Data Protection
- All data is protected by iOS's built-in security features
- Network communication uses standard TCP protocols
- No authentication tokens or passwords are stored
- Connection pairing is temporary and session-based

### No Vulnerabilities
- We do not collect sensitive data, so there's nothing to compromise
- Local-only communication reduces attack surface
- Regular security updates through App Store

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## International Users

Cue Bear is available worldwide. Since all data stays on your device and local network, there are no international data transfer concerns.

## Compliance

Cue Bear complies with:
- Apple's App Store Review Guidelines
- iOS Privacy Requirements
- GDPR (no data collection means no personal data to protect)
