## 🚀 How to Use

### One Command to Rule Them All

```bash
cd CueBearBridge/CueBearBridgeInstaller
./build_signed_installer.sh
```

**That's it!** This single command will:

1. ✅ Check for required certificates
2. ✅ Build CueBear Bridge app from Xcode
3. ✅ Bundle all 6 required dylibs
4. ✅ Bundle iproxy helper binary
5. ✅ Fix dylib install names (@rpath)
6. ✅ Sign all components with Developer ID
7. ✅ Create installer package (.pkg)
8. ✅ Sign package with Developer ID Installer
9. ✅ Submit to Apple for notarization
10. ✅ Wait for Apple approval (~10-15 mins)
11. ✅ Staple notarization ticket
12. ✅ Generate distribution-ready package

**Total Time:** 15-30 minutes (mostly waiting for Apple)

**Output:** `dist/CueBearBridge-Installer-notarized.pkg` - **READY TO SHIP!**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

Before running the installer build, you need:

### 1. Apple Developer Account
- Paid membership ($99/year)
- Sign up: https://developer.apple.com/programs/

### 2. Developer ID Certificates (Two Required)
- **Developer ID Application** - For signing the app
- **Developer ID Installer** - For signing the package
- Get from: https://developer.apple.com/account → Certificates

### 3. Notarization Credentials
Create and store app-specific password:

```bash
# Get app-specific password from: https://appleid.apple.com
# Get team ID from: https://developer.apple.com/account

xcrun notarytool store-credentials "cuebear-notarize" \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Code Signing
Uses Developer ID certificates to sign:
- App binary
- All dylibs
- Helper binaries
- Final package

### Hardened Runtime
Enables security protections:
- Library validation
- Dynamic linker protection
- Memory protections

### Notarization
Apple's automated security scan:
- Uploads package to Apple
- Scans for malicious code
- Issues notarization ticket
- Ticket is stapled to package

### Gatekeeper
macOS security system that:
- Checks code signature
- Verifies notarization
- Allows or blocks installation
