# 🔄 Retry Notarization Tomorrow

## ✅ What You Have Now

**Signed Installer Package:**
- File: `dist/CueBearBridge-Installer.pkg`
- Size: 26.8 MB
- Status: **Fully signed** with Developer ID certificates ✅
- Missing: Apple notarization ticket (due to Apple server delays)

**What Works:**
- ✅ App is code signed
- ✅ All dylibs are signed
- ✅ Helper binaries are signed
- ✅ Package is signed with Developer ID Installer
- ✅ Ready for notarization

**What Doesn't Work Yet:**
- ❌ Not notarized (Apple's servers were slow/stuck today)
- ❌ Users will see Gatekeeper warnings

---

## 📋 Tomorrow: Complete Notarization

### Simple One Command:

```bash
cd "/Users/omribehr/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Unsorted items/Cue Bear/CueBearBridge/CueBearBridgeInstaller"
./scripts/notarize_pkg.sh dist/CueBearBridge-Installer.pkg
```

That's it! Should take 10-20 minutes (normal speed).

### What Will Happen:

1. **Upload** (~2-5 mins) - Package uploads to Apple
2. **Apple Scan** (~5-15 mins) - Apple checks for security issues
3. **Stapling** (~10 secs) - Ticket attached to package
4. **Done!** You get `CueBearBridge-Installer-notarized.pkg`

## 🧪 For Testing Today (Optional)

Your signed package works, users just need to right-click → Open:

```bash
# Install locally to test
sudo installer -pkg dist/CueBearBridge-Installer.pkg -target /

# Launch
open /Applications/CueBearBridge.app
```

First launch:
1. macOS will show: "Cannot verify developer"
2. Click "Cancel"
3. Go to: System Settings → Privacy & Security
4. Click "Open Anyway"
5. App launches normally after that

## 📊 Today's Issue Summary

**Problem:** Apple's notarization service took 3+ hours (normally 10-20 minutes)

**Submissions:**
- Submission 1: `b4e23ab6-d7d8-4273-ba57-cfa94a0dedc5` (stuck "In Progress")
- Submission 2: `30dea56b-0ffe-43d9-86db-178a429bb6d9` (stuck "In Progress")

**Likely Cause:** Apple infrastructure issues (happens occasionally)

**Solution:** Retry tomorrow when Apple's servers are healthier

---

## ✨ What We Accomplished Today

1. ✅ Created complete installer system with scripts
2. ✅ Fixed certificate detection (Developer ID Installer now found)
3. ✅ Built signed installer package successfully
4. ✅ Signed all components (app, dylibs, helpers, package)
5. ✅ Set up notarization credentials
6. ✅ Submitted to Apple (waiting on Apple's slow servers)

**Everything is ready** - just need Apple to finish processing!

## 🎯 Tomorrow Morning:

**Step 1:** Run notarization
```bash
cd "/Users/omribehr/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Unsorted items/Cue Bear/CueBearBridge/CueBearBridgeInstaller"
./scripts/notarize_pkg.sh dist/CueBearBridge-Installer.pkg
```

**Step 2:** Wait 10-20 minutes

**Step 3:** Ship it! 🚀
- You'll get: `dist/CueBearBridge-Installer-notarized.pkg`
- Upload to your website or GitHub Releases
- Users install without any warnings!

## 🆘 If Tomorrow Also Has Issues

If Apple's servers are still slow tomorrow:

### Option 1: Check Apple Status
Visit: https://developer.apple.com/system-status/
Look for "Notary Service" status

### Option 2: Try Different Time
Apple's notarization is faster during off-peak hours (early morning US time)

### Option 3: Contact Apple
If consistent issues: https://developer.apple.com/contact/

### Option 4: Distribute Signed Package
Your signed package is secure - you can distribute it with instructions for users to right-click → Open
